### Project Concept

India plans to expand nuclear energy greatly. My research aims to understand the public’s perception of risk from nuclear power plants as well as other energy technologies. Existing research on risk from energy technologies has been carried out in a developed world context and has not studied economic aspects of risk perception like livelihood and land insecurity so crucial to developing countries. Further, research on social movements of India has revealed that political values underlie people’s acceptance or rejection of energy technologies.  

### Research Questions and Hypotheses

The central question is: What explains acceptance or rejection of nuclear energy in India, with the following more specific questions and hypotheses: 

1. How might acceptance of nuclear energy in India vary with different groups of people?  
    **H1:** Rural population of India will have less acceptance than the urban population of India.  
    **H2:** On average upper-caste Hindu males will have lower perceptions of environmental and technological risks.  
1. How are the perceptions of nuclear power different from that of other conventional sources of energy like coal or hydropower?  
    **H3:** Nuclear energy will be perceived as riskier than other sources of energy (coal or hydro) in India like in the west.
1. How do positions on trade-offs between land insecurity and income insecurity affect perceptions of risk?   
    **H4:** Higher-income insecurity will be correlated with higher acceptability of nuclear energy.  
    **H5:** Higher land security will be correlated with lower acceptance/rejection of nuclear energy.
1. Do political-economic values influence people’s perception of energy technologies?  
    * This is explored via a new political-economic value scale developed for this research. 

### Methods

I have collected data for two surveys. Each has data set consists of a thousand responses from a somewhat representative sample of the Indian population. The first seeks to understand the dependent variable – “acceptability of nuclear energy” in relation to income insecurity and livelihood insecurity. The second survey tests a newly developed political-economic value scale and its effect on the perception of risk. It also includes a well-tested scale developed by Kahan et al. (2007) widely used in risk perception studies.[^1]

### Statistical advice

1. I want to compare the new political-economic scale I have developed to the Kahan et al. (2007) scale. I would like some advice on the best way to do that. 
1. What is the best way to combine various items of a scale – arithmetic versus geometric mean. 
1. I believe the linear regression model should be a good fit for my study, but I’d like advice on if I should consider any other models. I have used a 5-point likert scale on a lot of questions. 
1. Considering my sampling technique for the survey, I would like to understand the limitations of any conclusions I can draw from my results.
